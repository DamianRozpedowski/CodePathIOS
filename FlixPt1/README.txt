### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- A major challenge I faced when building this app was making the Table Cells appear, I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure what was wrong with my
code and I realized that this wasn't a problem with my code but with the naming of my ViewController and TableViewCell, I changed the names of these and it
ended up breaking my code so I resorted to keeping the names of the files as their default and it worked perfectly.
